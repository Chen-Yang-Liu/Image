The map shows a prominent water body extending from the upper portion towards the lower region. Flanking this are areas of grassland transitioning into forested regions, with a noticeable patch of forest in the center. Barren land is prevalent, particularly in the surrounding expanses. A sparse cluster of buildings is positioned near the central forest, adjacent to a pathway that meanders past the forest and buildings. Farmland is not depicted on this map.
